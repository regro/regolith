% the jinja2 template is just latex, as you can see, but it can
% fill in information coming from the variables sent by the
% navy_letter program.  These are a big dictionary called
% contents and a few other small things, like to and from.
% We can write simple code in here to do the rendering, so
% if we have a list of entries, it can be any length and we just
% wrap it in a for loop.  You can see the syntax below to get
% the idea.

Beamplan
========
Information about the experiment plan for the beamtime.

Schema
------
The following lists key names mapped to its type and meaning for each entry.

:_id: string, Unique identifier for the experiment plan. It should have a format '{year:2d}{month:2d}{people_id:s}_{plan_name:s}', required
:beamtime: string, The id for the beamtime. Check the Airtable., required
:begin_date: ['string', 'datetime', 'date'], The begin date of the beam time., required
:devices: list, The dictionary of devices used in the measurement e. g. , required

	:type: string, optional
:end_date: ['string', 'datetime', 'date'], The end date of the beam time., required
:exp_plan: list, Steps to carry out the experiments at BNL. Need details, required

	:type: string, optional
:holder: string, Sample holder used during the measurement, e. g. 3 mm OD tubes holder., required
:measurement: string, What data to be measured, e. g. PDF, XRD, SAXS. This will determine the setup., required
:notes: ['list', 'string'], Notes of the plan, e. g. the preferred time., optional

	:type: string, optional
:objective: string, What to study in the experiments. What goal to achieve., required
:pipeline: string, The analysis pipeline for the experiment. If no new pipeline is needed, use 'usual'., required
:prep_plan: list, Steps to prepare the samples. Do NOT need details., required

	:type: string, optional
:project: string, The id for the project which the plan belongs to. It should be on airtable., required
:project_lead: string, The id for person who put out this plan. It should be inside the people.yml., required
:samples: list, The list of samples to be measured., required

	:type: string, optional
:scanplan: list, The scanplan for the experiment, e. g. tseries, Tramp, ct., required

	:type: string, optional
:ship_plan: list, Steps to carry the samples from the producer to the BNL. Do NOT need details., required

	:type: string, optional
:time: integer, The total time of executing the exp_plan. Unit: min., required
:todo: list, The TODO list before the beamtime., required

	:type: string, optional


YAML Example
------------

.. code-block:: yaml

	test:
	  beamtime: 2020-1-XPD
	  begin_date: '2020-01-01'
	  devices:
	    - cryostream
	  end_date: '2020-01-02'
	  exp_plan:
	    - load samples on the holder
	    - scan the holder to locate the samples
	    - take room temperature measurement of sample and the subtrate
	    - ramp down temperature to 100K
	    - ramp up, measure PDF at temperature 100K ~ 300K, 10K stepsize, 1 min exposure
	  holder: film holder (1 cm * 1 cm * 1 mm)
	  measurement: Tramp
	  objective: temperature ramping PDF of one WO3 film (100, 300K, 10K)
	  pipeline: usual
	  prep_plan:
	    - films will be made by kriti
	  project: 20ks_wo3
	  project_lead: kseth
	  samples:
	    - WO3 film
	    - glass subtrate
	  scanplan:
	    - Scanplan(bt, Tramp, 30, 80, 500, 10)
	  ship_plan:
	    - seal and ship to CU
	    - carry to the beamline
	  time: 190
	  todo:
	    - todo something

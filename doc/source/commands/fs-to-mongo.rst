fs-to-mongo
========
This command is used to port collections from the filesystem to either a local
or remote mongo cluster on a specific database. The following codeblock can be
utilized as the body of a regolithrc.json file in the local directory adjacent
to a db directory containing json or yaml files. This specific setup is used to
export to a remote atlas cluster (as indicated by the +srv). In order to do so,
the text encapsulated by the <> brackets must be completed for your application.

This functionality relies on the subprocess calls to a locally running mongo
instance regardless of whether or not the user is importing to a local or remote
instance. This can be downloaded from the following link:

    audience:
      - Who will use the software or read the paper? Your target audience. e.g., beginning
        grad in chemistry
    success_def: audience is happy
    scope:
      - If this is a software release, list any use-cases that are in scope. These
        may be located in the Gdoc associated with the prum.  Otherwise include some
        other kind of scope description of what is in and what is not
      - 'If this is a science paper summarize: '
      - the scientific question that is being answered
      - any hypotheses that will be tested to answer it
      - the approach that will be taken
    platform: description of how and where the audience will access the deliverable.  The
      journal where it will be submitted if it is a paper. Whether it is a web-app,
      or which operating systems will be supported, for software
    roll_out:
      - steps that the audience will take to access and interact with the deliverable
      - leave as empty list for paper submissions

      objective: This acts as an example milestone. It shows how to construct your
        milestones.  It should be deleted before depositing the prum.
      audience:
        - update the audience as required, but it is often lead, pi and group_members
          (see below). these resolve to their values defined elsewhere.  If putting
          in people's names use their ids where possible and they will be looked for
          in the people and contacts collections.

      notes:
        - () get a clear picture of the deliverable and what needs to be done to get
          there.  Have discussions with group members to develop ideas.  Propose them
          even if you are not sure, you will get feedback. This is the process.
        - () edit the template 'deliverable' to reflect that.
        - () chart out milestones at a high level first working back from the deliverable.  'To
          deliver that (deliverable) I have to do this, this and this, and to deliver
          it by then I have to do these things by these dates.'
        - "() then write the detailed milestones, turning each one into a deliverable\
          \ that is captured in the type field.  Allowed values for milestone types\
          \ are: ('mergedpr', 'meeting', 'other', 'paper', 'release', 'email', 'handin',\
          \ 'purchase', 'approval', 'presentation', 'report', 'submission', 'decision',\
          \ 'demo', 'skel').  If you are tempted to use 'other' think more about the\
          \ milestone objective, you probably haven't defined it well enough in your\
          \ head."
        - () Think carefully about the deliverable date.  Can you hit it?  If not,
          change it so you can hit it.  You may have to adjust your final deliverable
          date but discuss this with the team, because scope could also be reduced
          rather than pushing off final deliverable.  When you are comfortable with
          the due date, and it has been reviewed, make the appoint on the calendar,
          for example, if it is a meeting or presentation, send schedule it now.
        - () within each milestone, make a todo list (this is a todo-list) in the
          notes field.  A todo is a note prepended by () (no space in the middle).  These
          are the smaller tasks you will have to do to complete the milestone.  When
          you complete them turn () in to (x).
        - () Iterate all these with your team/advisor maybe in a Google doc or on
          Slack to make sure you are on the right track.  To converge this shoot for
          multiple round-trips per day.
        - () using u_milestones in helper_gui, or otherwise, get them entered into
          the prum and the prum deposited.
        - () by the time the edited prum is submitted, set all the statuses to converged
          or started, and delete this example milestone.
        - () later, when you finish a milestone use u_milestones or editing in the
          yaml file set status to finished and add an end_date, and fill in the progress
          section. This should be brief but just links to a brief text description
          of the outcome that would be suitable for a grant annual report, and any
          url links to presentations or related docs.  Link to specific files of relevance
          to this milestone not general docs and repos.
      progress:
        text: write text here capturing how the milestone is progressing, but at the
          least when the milestone closes.  The goal of this is that it will be printed
          as a progress report for a grant so write it as if it will be read by an
          external person. It doesnt have to describe the whole prum but clearly show
          the progress that has been made. It can be multiple paragraphs or a short
          statementdepending on the situation

            figures in it, or a Gdoc with more complicated info like tables or something.
            This is for the PI to be able to find quality content to augment the report>
          - <replace with another URL if more than one is needed>

A step-by-step pathway towards PDF understanding.  It is recommended to read the papers in the order they are listed here.

[1] Very basic, but brief, intro to powder diffraction in general:
    Overview and principles of powder diffraction, R. E. Dinnebier, and S. J. L. Billinge, International Tables for Crystallography, pp.2-23, (2019).\\
    DOI: 10.1107/97809553602060000935
[2] Lightest weight overview of PDF analysis around.  Good starting point:
    Chapter 16. Local Structure from Total Scattering and Atomic Pair Distribution Function (PDF) Analysis, Simon Billinge, Powder Diffraction, pp.464-493, (2008).\\
    DOI: 10.1039/9781847558237-00464

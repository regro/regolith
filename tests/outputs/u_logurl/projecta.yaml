      notes:
        - () get a clear picture of the deliverable and what needs to be done to get
          there
        - () make milestones which should also be deliverables (e.g., presentation,
          meeting, etc.) that accomplish all the steps to get to the deliverable
        - () think if good due dates for everything and shoot for hitting them.  Either
          work back from a deadline for the deliverable, or work forward to guide
          you to a reasonable deadline for the prum deliverable.
        - () using u_milestones in helper_gui, or otherwise, get them entered into
          the prum
        - () schedule a meeting with the PI to go over them and converge them

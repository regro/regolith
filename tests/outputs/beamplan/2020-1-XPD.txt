Experiment 1
------------
Objective:
    temperature ramping PDF of one WO3 film (100, 300K, 10K)
Samples:
- WO3 film
- glass subtrate
Scanplan:
- Scanplan(bt, Tramp, 30, 80, 500, 10)
Preparation:
- films will be made by kriti
Shipment:
- seal and ship to CU
- carry to the beamline
Measurement:
- load samples on the holder
- scan the holder to locate the samples
- take room temperature measurement of sample and the subtrate
- ramp down temperature to 100K
- ramp up, measure PDF at temperature 100K ~ 300K, 10K stepsize, 1 min exposure
Scanplan:
- Scanplan(bt, Tramp, 30, 80, 500, 10)

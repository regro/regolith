* What are the major goals of the project?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In real-world applications, materials are rarely perfect crystals and their properties
depend sensitively on defects, nanoscale structures, interfaces, surfaces and multi-scale
heterogeneities. A major challenge is to gain a greater understanding of how such
"imperfect" materials operate, including on different length and time-scales. In situations
as complicated as this it is essential to validate theories against experiment, and vice versa.
A more tightly coupled partnership between experiment and theory is needed, having its roots
in information theory: the models need to capture all the physics of the problem become more
complicated, while at the same time the information content of experimental data is reduced,
due to lower resolution from finite size effects, defects, the presence of multiple components
with overlapping problems, which yield unreliable and non-unique solutions, a bottleneck to
predictive materials discovery. We will develop novel mathematical approaches to address this
problem. We will study as a test case the nanostructure inverse problem (NIP), a well defined
but generally ill-posed materials inverse problem; however, the methods that we develop will
have much broader applicability in the world of materials discovery.

Goal 1: Develop databases of nanostructure data from model systems
Goal 2: Develop data analytic and stochastic optimization methodologies for robust
nanostructure solutions
Goal 3: Develop software infrastructure for nanostructure modeling that use the databases
and the new methodologies for nanostructure solution
Goal 4: Apply this to real scientific problems

* What was accomplished under these goals (you must provide information for
at least one of the 4 categories below)?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Major Activities (currently worked on projecta):
PDF in the cloud (PDFitc): Development of a web-based service for determining
structures from measured PDFs given known structures in structural databases
xpdTools, xpdAcq, xpdAn, xpdView: Software tools for streaming data analysis
and visualization of diffraction data from the XPD diffractometer at NSLS-II
synchrotron. The tools can also be used to analyze data from other diffraction
beamlines.

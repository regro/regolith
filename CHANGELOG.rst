====================
Regolith Change Log
====================

.. current developments

v0.1.10
====================

**Added:**

* Regolith commands can run using a local db rather than a remote
* ``LatexBuilderBase`` a base class for building latex documents
* Users can override keys in each collection's schema via the RC
* Command for validating the combined database ``regolith validate``


**Changed:**

* ``CVBuilder`` and ``ResumeBuilder`` builders now inheret from ``LatexBuilderBase``


**Fixed:**

* Use get syntax with ``filter_publications`` in case author not in dict
* If a collection is not in the schema it is auto valid




v0.1.9
====================

**Fixed:**

* ``all_documents`` now returns the values of an empty dict if the collection
  doesn't exist




v0.1.8
====================

**Added:**

* Database clients now merge collections across databases so records across
  public and private databases can be put together. This is in
  ``client.chained_db``.

* Blacklist for db files (eg. ``travis.yml``) the default (if no blacklist is
  specified in the ``rc`` is to blacklist ``['.travis.yml', '.travis.yaml']``
* Schemas and exemplars for the collections.
  Database entries are checked against the schema, making sure that all the
  required fields are filled and the values are the same type(s) listed in the
  schema. The schema also includes descriptions of the data to be included.
  The exemplars are examples which have all the specified fields and are
  used to check the validation.
* Docs auto generate for collections (if they were documented in the schema).


**Changed:**

* ``all_docs_from_collection`` use the ``chained_db`` to pull from all dbs at
  once. This is a breaking API change for ``rc.client.all_documents``
* App now validates incoming data against schema


**Deprecated:**

* Mongo database support is being deprecated (no ``chained_db`` support)


**Fixed:**

* Properly implemented the classlist ``replace`` operation.
* Fixed issue with classlist insertions using Mongo-style API
  (deprecated).
* Properly filter on course ids when emailing.
* ``fsclient`` dbs explicitly load 'utf-8' files, which fixes an issue on
  Windows
